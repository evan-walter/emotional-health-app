# Emotional Health App

## About

I created this app as a tool to help others and myself to be present, process emotions, and find resources for emotional health. This topic is a passion of mine, and I am excited to share and create it with you!

## Roadmap

This app is in development. I am just getting started! Follow along with my plans and notes for this app below.

### Brainstorming

#### General Notes and Ideas for the App

I'd like for users to be able to use certain tools, such as [Laura Duncan](https://www.instagram.com/lauraduncanconsulting)'s Remote Control Exercise, 5-Minute Exercise, and more.

I also want to have a blog and some sort of resources for users.

Some AI functionality would be cool.

I'd like to have the option for notifications, such as email notifications or daily reminders the user can specify to pause, etc.

Some note-taking and ability to store those notes would be cool.

I might like to have a social aspect, like a profile page, bio, and ability to keep track and process with other users

#### Features Brainstorming

- Exercises (ability to save records of the exercises. Or just make it front-end for now?)
  - 5-Minute Exercise
  - Remote Control Exercise
  - Words of Compassion
  - Fathers and Mothers
  - Child Self
- Blog
- Resources
- AI Companion

  - Use ML to generate compassion phrases as the user trains the model, specifically tailored to the user.

- Try to build an app that would, as closely as possible, replicate life consultants and everything they do, including training other life consultants.

- Have daily words, like the Bible app verse of the day. Have a word of encouragement of the day or something.

- Maybe have the entire thing be AI-centric. Or the option to turn on or off certain features of it. For instance, have a ChatGPT-like interaction as
  e user steps through the remote control exercise.

##### Notes on the Features Above

- Exercises
  - Record and show the user their own data/analytics of what types of issues often come up for them. Also use this data to train the AI model.
  - Add new features to each exercise to enrich the experience. Put your own touch.

---

#### New App Ideas

- Website hub for creators to showcase their work and to connect with potential or existing customers. Like a platform. Perhaps like another Psychology Today or something.
