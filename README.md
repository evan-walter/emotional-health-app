# Emotional Health App

## About

I created this app as a tool to help others and myself to be present, process emotions, and find resources for emotional health. This topic is a passion of mine, and I am excited to share and create it with you!

## Roadmap

This app is in development. I am just getting started! Follow along with my plans and notes for this app below.

### Brainstorming

#### General Notes and Ideas for the App

I'd like for users to be able to use certain tools, such as [Laura Duncan](https://www.instagram.com/lauraduncanconsulting)'s Remote Control Exercise, 5-Minute Exercise, and more.

I also want to have a blog and some sort of resources for users.

Some AI functionality would be cool.

I'd like to have the option for notifications, such as email notifications or daily reminders the user can specify to pause, etc.

Some note-taking and ability to store those notes would be cool.

I might like to have a social aspect, like a profile page, bio, and ability to keep track and process with other users
